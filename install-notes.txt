After getting boot2Docker properly set up.

vagrant up demo
Accumulo etc. comes up fine. Jetty is not serving Lumify app.

Put war in /opt/jetty/webapps.

Missing configuration.

Added LUMIFY_DIR env variable and put lumify.properties and log4j in there.

That fixed config issue. Now complaint about not accessing hdfs do to unknownhost lumify-dev.

After restart networking fixed.

Static assets are not being served, getting 404.

Had to build static resources with grunt after doing npm install.

Need to follow steps 3 and 4 from https://github.com/lumifyio/lumify/blob/master/docker/README.md#docker-web-server.

This got login but it didn't work. Missing cytoscape???

Do npm config set bin-links false. This fixes symlink error in grunt deps.

Needed to do npm install. Then grunt deps. Then grunt. Then mvn package...

Run all mvn and npm commands from windows host.

Need to install plugins for everything. 

dev-tools web pulgin for additional admin features (ontology upload).

Jetty restart required for plugin loading.
